I'd like to say that you're a few person in this world to understand the real meaning of your existance, but if you don't understand, try to question your existance until you find the real answer but not the answer that you think it is. You have to be sure and logicaly think of a reason.

Here's some hint to find your meaning "We are born to understand reality and to realize that everyting is fascinating and beautiful even though it's painful to live in this world".

the real truth is pain is inevitable but suffering is optional, it's on you whether your suffer or not.
